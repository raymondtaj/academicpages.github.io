Data Analyst & Data Scientist & Data Engineer
======
Hi! I’m **Raymond Tao**, a Data Analyst and M.Eng. candidate in Operations Research and Information Engineering at **Cornell University**, passionate about solving real-world business problems with data science, optimization, and analytics.

My background includes a **B.S. in Mathematics & Statistics from the University of Michigan**, and professional experience spanning **data science, machine learning, marketing analytics, and supply chain optimization**.

Most recently, I interned at **Global AI**, where I built scoring frameworks and automated ETL pipelines to evaluate mineral investment opportunities across 80+ countries. I also worked at **Soul Mates Bridal** analyzing social media metrics and improving campaign ROI, and at **Hirebeat**, where I developed data pipelines and designed relational schemas for recruitment analytics.

At Cornell, I’m leading a **capstone project for Wegmans**, using XGBoost and MILP to reduce PO delays and optimize trailer usage in their supply chain. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights and have hands-on experience with Python, R, SQL, and cloud tools like AWS and Spark.

Let’s connect and explore how data can drive smarter decisions!
