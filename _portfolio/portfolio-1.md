## Global AI – Data Science & Machine Learning Intern  
**New York, NY**

At Global AI, I worked on a strategic project supporting the setup of a critical minerals investment fund, backed by a group of governments. The goal was to advise public and private stakeholders on which mining assets to buy, hold, or exit, in order to strengthen their positions in the global energy transition.

I contributed to the development of a comprehensive, multi-source mining intelligence database containing over 6,000 companies across 80+ countries. This database included company-level financials (balance sheets, income statements), mine-level production capacity, critical mineral exposure (e.g., lithium, copper, cobalt), geopolitical stability indicators (CPIA, RGI), infrastructure scores, and export volume data.

**My responsibilities included:**

- **Collecting and integrating** diverse datasets—including balance sheets, income statements, asset ownership, and commodity breakdowns—to evaluate each mining company’s operational and financial status.
- Designing **a multi-factor scoring system** to assess company value based on mineral exposure, profitability, risk, and strategic fit with national interests.
- Building **ETL pipelines** to automate the ingestion and cleaning of financial data, ensuring the database remains accurate and up-to-date with quarterly reports and global M&A activity.
- Creating **country-level dashboards and investment summaries** to support government decision-making in mineral asset allocation, acquisition strategies, and inter-country trade analysis.

## Hirebeat – Data Analyst Intern  
**Jersey City, NJ**

At Hirebeat, I contributed to the company’s recruitment intelligence infrastructure. I designed relational schemas and built over 30 SQL tables to structure hiring funnel data, track interview progress, and analyze employer engagement. I also developed an ETL pipeline to centralize recruitment data into MongoDB, which improved real-time analytics and reduced data processing time by 20%. In parallel, I cleaned and standardized over 10,000 candidate records using AWS Glue, ensuring high data quality.
